Dutch National Flag Problem

Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You
should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s,
and 2s to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue;
and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is
why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.
