1295: Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits

Given an array nums of integers, return how many of them contain an even
number of digits.

/*
Interesting side-note: using the ternary operator in lines 16-17 slows
things down: current runs 72ms, faster than 93.16% of Leetcode submissions.

Inless I'm mistaken, time complexity is O(a log k), where a is the length
of the array, and k is the size of the array-item number.
